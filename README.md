# Burger Menu with Framer Motion

A React-based project featuring a smooth, animated burger menu using Framer Motion (now referred to as `motion`). The menu toggles a sliding navigation panel with a clean, responsive design.

## Features

- **Animated Burger Menu**: Smooth transitions for the burger icon, transforming into an "X" when toggled, powered by Framer Motion.
- **Sliding Navigation**: A side navigation panel that slides in and out with a 1-second ease-in-out transition.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS for a mobile-friendly layout.
- **State Management**: Uses React's `useState` hook to manage the open/closed state of the menu.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: Frontend framework for building the UI.
- **Framer Motion**: Animation library for smooth transitions and burger menu animations.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Modern JavaScript for functionality.
